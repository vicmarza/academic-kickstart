# Hi, have we met before? Please let me introduce myself.   

Born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I'm a scientist, probably because I was a curious child (I enjoyed dis/assembling toys and drumming gear just to understand how they work... I lost a lot of them of course).  Also, living in Santiago around the 1990's, I always had an environmental "menace". Air pollution stopped me several times from playing, exercising, and enjoying the city. Then I learned that several other places in the world suffer from this and other environmental problems.

Now, I investigate the "scars" that the environment leaves in our genome. I envision my research contributing to prevent diseases caused by exposure to environmental agents.  

Thanks for your time,  


Victor


# Now, a more "official" biography

Victor  received his Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Chile, before joining the British Columbia Cancer Research Centre in Vancouver, Canada. He leads several ‘big data’ projects that investigate cancer etiology and tumor biology, with a long-term vision of translating his findings to benefit cancer patients. Dr. Martinez’s publications span multiple disciplines, including cancer biology, genomics, epigenetics, and computational biology.  He is internationally recognized for his work on non-coding RNA transcriptome, and has received multiple awards for his contributions to the field of environmental cancer genomics.  Currently, he serves on the editorial boards of Scientific Reports and Biomed Research International
