# Welcome to my Academic Portfolio.  
Please, let me introduce myself: Born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I'm a scientist, probably because I was a curious child (I could spend hours playing around with toys and drumming gear just to understand how they work... of course, I lost so many pieces). Breathing Santiago's air around the 1990's was equivalent to smoke ~10 cigarettes per day, so air pollution stopped me several times from playing, exercising, and enjoying my city. Then, I discovered that being exposed to these agents could lead to the development of several diseases, including cancer, and that this is a global problem.

I decided to investigate the molecular "scars" that the environment and other agents leave in our genome. To this end, I use sequencing technologies to understand the damage occurring at genome and epigenome levels. I envision my research contributing to prevent diseases by identifying early markers of disease, particularly amongst the most vulnerable populations.  

Thanks for your time.
