### **Hi, have we met before? Please let me introduce myself...**   

Born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I'm a scientist, probably because I was a curious child (I enjoyed dis/assembling toys and drumming gear just to understand how they work... I lost a lot of them of course).  Also, living in Santiago around the 1990's, I always had an environmental "menace". Air pollution stopped me several times from playing, exercising, and enjoying the city. Then I learned that several other places in the world suffer from this and other environmental problems.

Now, I investigate the "scars" that the environment leaves in our genome. I envision my research contributing to prevent diseases caused by exposure to environmental agents.  

Thanks for your time.
