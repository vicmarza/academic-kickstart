# Welcome to my Academic Portfolio.  

Please, let me introduce myself: Born and raised in Santiago, Chile. I'm a scientist, probably because I was a curious child (I enjoyed playing around with toys and drumming gear just to understand how they work... Of course, I lost so much pieces). Btreathing Santiago's air around the 1990's was equivalent to smoke ~10 cigarettes per day. Air pollution stopped me several times from playing, exercising, and enjoying my city. Then I learned that several other places in the world suffer from this and other environmental problems.

Today, I investigate the molecular "scars" that the environment leaves in our genome. I envision my research contributing to prevent diseases caused by exposure to environmental agents, particularly amongst the most vulnerable populations.  

Thanks for your time.
