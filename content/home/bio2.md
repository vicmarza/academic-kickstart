I am a passionate scientist and entrepreneur. While completing my Ph.D. in Chile, I pioneer the discovery of genomic alterations occurring in people exposed to arsenic, which resulted in a long-standing collaboration with the British Columbia Cancer Research Centre (BCCRC) in Vancouver, Canada. After that, I partnered up with a former Chilean Government officer to start a consultancy firm (Plataforma360), helping Institutions such as the National Institute of Intellectual Property, amongst others. As science is in the core for my professional development, I didn’t hesitate on accepting a postdoctoral fellow position at the BCCRC. Here, my proudest achievement has been to whiteness how the platform I developed for the analysis of NGS-based projects has supported several projects and grant applications, and how the team I have trained is now independently leading their projects. Throughout these years, I have also advanced my career as a researcher investigating the environment, genomic and human disease. Now, I’m pursuing my next professional challenge: putting my research at disposal of impacting health on vulnerable populations.
