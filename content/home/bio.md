### **Now, a more "official" bio**

Victor  received his Ph.D. in Biomedical Sciences from the University of Chile, before joining the British Columbia Cancer Research Centre in Vancouver, Canada. He leads several ‘big data’ projects that investigate cancer etiology and tumor biology, with a long-term vision of translating his findings to benefit cancer patients. Dr. Martinez’s publications span multiple disciplines, including cancer biology, genomics, epigenetics, and computational biology.  He is internationally recognized for his work on non-coding RNA transcriptome, and has received multiple awards for his contributions to the field of environmental cancer genomics.  Currently, he serves on the editorial boards of Scientific Reports and Biomed Research International
